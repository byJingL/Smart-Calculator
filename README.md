This calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to handle long expressions.

Supported:

- A sequence of `+` (like `+++` or `+++++`) or A sequence of `-` (like `--` or `---`)
- Varibles

## Main Skill
stack, queue, deque, postfix notation, regular expression
## Theory
Postfix notation, also known as Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is used in this program. 
Stack (LIFO) is used to convert an expression from infix to postfix notation. Queue (FIFO) and stack (LIFO) are used to calculate based on postfix expression.
